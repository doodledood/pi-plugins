# figure-out: docs mode

The loading layer activates this reference only after the investigation is relevant to the active project or one of its mapped contexts. It adds three behaviors from that point: **bootstrap** (initialize CONTEXT.md if missing), **inline glossary captures** (write project vocabulary as terms surface), and **ADR offers** (record decisions worth keeping).

## Override: these writes ARE the action

The master frame in `SKILL.md` says answers and agreement feed exploration, not action — don't leap to the implied move, not the edit, not even the proposal.

When project docs are active, that frame has two explicit exceptions. **Glossary captures and ADR offers are not deferred work — they are the action of this mode.** Execute them inline as they trigger. Do not batch to the end of the session. Do not wait for the user to ask. The writes are the deliverable; the deferred-action posture does not apply to them.

(The default figure-out posture still applies to everything else — design proposals, code edits, plan synthesis. Only glossary writes and ADR offers carve out.)

## Bootstrap (when project relevance exists)

Once project relevance exists, resolve the active context file and load it if it exists:

1. **`CONTEXT-MAP.md` at root** → the repo has multiple contexts. Follow the map to the relevant context's `CONTEXT.md`. Ask which context if unclear.
2. **No `CONTEXT-MAP.md`** → the active context is the repo-root `CONTEXT.md`.
3. **Active `CONTEXT.md` exists** → load it as evidence. Project vocabulary is a source the user is already working from.
4. **Active `CONTEXT.md` is missing** → offer minimal initialization for that context: *"No CONTEXT.md exists for this repo/context. Want a minimal scaffold I can grow as terms resolve?"* On accept, write a starter file at the active context path (context name, one-sentence purpose, empty Language section). On decline, skip the proactive scaffold and don't re-offer it for that context — but subsequent per-turn glossary captures may still create the active `CONTEXT.md` lazily on first earned resolution. (Declining the scaffold only declines the *proactive* write, not the inline captures that docs mode exists for.)
5. **Multiple distinct domains emerge mid-session** → propose splitting via `CONTEXT-MAP.md` + per-context `CONTEXT.md`. Don't do this preemptively; only when the conversation actually crosses domain boundaries. If the user accepts a split and a relevant per-context `CONTEXT.md` is missing, offer the same minimal initialization for that new context.

## Glossary captures (per-turn, inline, no offer)

**After every counterparty response — or, in self-answered runs, every resolved question —** check for glossary candidates — but write only candidates that pass the earned-entry gate.

A candidate earns entry when it would help a future agent model this project correctly because at least one is true:

- **Project-specific meaning** — the term means something here that ordinary English or generic tool knowledge would not supply.
- **Ambiguity reduction** — confusing it with a near-synonym, alias, or overloaded term would change behavior.
- **Durable workflow boundary** — the term marks where responsibility, authority, completion, or verification changes hands.
- **Load-bearing relationship** — the relationship/cardinality between terms changes how future work should be understood.
- **Observed ambiguity** — the session exposed a clash with existing vocabulary or resolved a fuzzy term into a canonical one.

Do **not** capture merely because a noun was defined. Do not write obvious ordinary terms, generic platform vocabulary without a project-specific meaning, implementation labels, file paths, code structure, design decisions, or one-off explanations. If an existing entry already covers the term, do not rewrite it unless the user's meaning conflicts with it or materially sharpens it.

Signals that can trigger a write after the earned-entry gate passes:

- **A project-language term got defined** — user used a term with project-specific meaning and stated what they mean by it.
- **A load-bearing relationship got stated or changed** — user articulated a relationship or cardinality between project-language terms that would change future understanding.
- **A clash with the existing glossary** — user's term conflicts with an existing `CONTEXT.md` entry.
- **A fuzzy term got canonicalized** — agent or user proposed a canonical name for an overloaded term and it stuck.

If a signal fires and the candidate earns entry → **write to `CONTEXT.md` before asking the next question. No offer, no batch.** Capture as it happens. Create `CONTEXT.md` lazily on the first resolution if it doesn't exist (per Bootstrap above). If the gate does not pass, do not write; keep figuring out.

When the user's term conflicts with the existing glossary, surface the clash as a lead: *"Glossary defines X as A; you seem to mean B — which is it?"*

When the user uses a fuzzy or overloaded term, propose a canonical one: *"'Account' — Customer or User? Different things."* The user's articulation, not your inference, disambiguates.

## ADR offers (two-pass capture)

This section carries the gate — everything needed to decide *whether* to offer, per turn, without loading another file. The write-time mechanics (template, MADR sections, naming, lifecycle, immutability, cross-references) live in the adjacent **`ADR_FORMAT.md`** — read it only when an offer is accepted and an ADR is about to be written.

### The gate

The threshold is **downstream architectural impact** — decisions that shape the system's structure, constrain future options, or would be costly to reverse. The gate is category match + Decision Test + anti-patterns; there is no separate AND-of-conditions trigger.

**ADR-worthy (record these):**

| Source | What to capture |
|--------|----------------|
| **Architecture choices** | Technology, patterns, component structure, integration approach |
| **Trade-off resolutions** | When competing concerns were weighed and one was preferred |
| **Scope decisions with rationale** | Deliberate inclusion/exclusion that shapes the system boundary |
| **Key constraint decisions** | Invariants established from multiple valid options |
| **Approach pivots** | When implementation adjusts architecture based on reality |

**NOT ADR-worthy (skip these):**

| Category | Why not |
|----------|---------|
| **Quality gate selections** | Verification configuration, not architecture |
| **Process guidance defaults** | How-to-work, not system structure |
| **Mechanical choices** | Obvious implementations with no meaningful alternatives |
| **Known assumptions** | Defaults chosen without deliberation — no alternatives weighed |
| **Bug fixes** | Corrections, not decisions (unless the fix involves an architectural choice) |

**Decision Test** (when uncertain): *"Would a new team member joining in 6 months benefit from knowing WHY this was decided this way?"* If yes → ADR. If they'd just accept it as obvious → skip.

### Pass 1 — per-turn (high-confidence)

**After every counterparty response — or, in self-answered runs, every resolved question —** check the gate above. When it fires *clearly* on a decision just articulated — user chose B over A with explicit reasoning, a scope boundary just got drawn, a key constraint just got named — **offer immediately**:

> *"This looks ADR-worthy — [name the category and the Decision Test result]. Want me to record it?"*

On accept: write per `ADR_FORMAT.md` (template, MADR sections, filename `YYYYMMDD-kebab-title.md`). Capture alternatives from the conversation you just had — if the user picked B over A, that's exactly what goes in the Alternatives Considered section. If alternatives weren't articulated, ask before writing: *"What did we consider and reject? I want to capture that in Alternatives."*

### Pass 2 — session-end sweep (recall guarantee)

**Before naming the read** (or handing off to `/define`), review the session for ADR candidates that didn't trigger Pass 1. Apply the same gate. Present any survivors as a **batched offer**:

> *"Before we lock this in — these came up that look ADR-worthy: [N items, one line each: title + why]. Record any?"*

For each accepted, write per `ADR_FORMAT.md`. Skip the sweep if the conversation didn't actually produce decisions worth capturing — an empty sweep is fine.

The two-pass shape exists because per-turn alone misses subtle decisions (the gate fires only at high confidence to keep interruption low), and sweep-only loses immediacy (alternatives are freshest right after the decision is made). Both passes together = inline coverage matches what a post-hoc sweep would catch.

## CONTEXT.md format

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentences: what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
A request placed by a customer for one or more items.
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction.

**Customer**:
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account.

## Relationships

- An **Order** produces one or more **Invoices**.
- An **Invoice** belongs to exactly one **Customer**.

## Flagged ambiguities

- "account" used to mean both **Customer** and **User** — resolved: distinct concepts.
```

Rules:

- One sentence per definition. What it IS, not what it does.
- Bold term names; list aliases under `_Avoid_:` when multiple words competed.
- Show cardinality in Relationships when load-bearing.
- Project-specific vocabulary and conceptual relationships only — no architecture, file paths, code structure, or design decisions. Implementation belongs in ADRs.

## Multi-context repos

If `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at the root, the repo has multiple contexts. The map lists each context's path and inter-context relationships; each context's `CONTEXT.md` lives in its module with context-specific ADRs alongside.

When multiple contexts exist, infer which one the current topic belongs to. Ask if unclear.
