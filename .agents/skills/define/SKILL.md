Encode the conversation's shared understanding as a Manifest at `~/.manifest-dev/manifests/manifest-{ts}.md` (create the dir; `~` = `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%`) — a durable home so manifests survive OS temp cleanup across multi-day work. Fall back to a writable temp path (`/tmp/`, else `$TMPDIR` / `%TEMP%`) only when the home directory isn't writable. If the transcript lacks shared understanding, invoke `manifest-dev:figure-out` first; propagate `--autonomous` when invoked from `/auto` or `/do`'s amendment path. **Pre-flight:** if `--babysit <pr-url>`, load `references/BABYSIT_MODE.md` and follow its synthesis flow; if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a manifest file path, amend (see below); else fresh.

**Encoding discipline.** figure-out reaches shared understanding of the *problem*; /define handles manifest-specific *encoding* judgment calls — invariant vs process guidance, AC scope and pass threshold, phase ordering (fast vs slow), trade-offs to record as `[T-N]`. Surface the load-bearing encoding decisions briefly with a recommended answer before encoding; auto-decide the rest and mark `(auto)` + matching ASM. The manifest is the acceptance contract — what the user accepts as *"I'd ship the outcome of executing this."*

Consume `Known Assumption candidate` items from the latest figure-out Read: encode each still-unresolved candidate as an `ASM-*` entry with its default and impact if wrong; omit candidates that later evidence or the user resolved. Do not copy the full Evidence Ledger into the Manifest.

Criteria the user pinned by *reacting* to something concrete during figure-out — a mock, a reference, a chosen direction — are success criteria, not flavor: encode them in the preserved layer — an Acceptance Criterion or Global Invariant when a verifier can judge them (qualitatively is fine, e.g. a subagent checking the result against the named reference), Process Guidance when they must hold but resist verification. Never fold them into the soft Initial Approach, where /do may pivot away from them. This routes onto existing structure; it adds no new manifest section.

**Task files.** Identify task type and load the matching file(s) from `tasks/` — their Quality Gates auto-encode as INV-G*/AC-* and Defaults as PG-* before the interview (surface each as it lands so the dialogue carries the encoding forward). These define task files carry **encoder data only**; probing fuel lives in figure-out's own parallel probe files (`skills/figure-out/tasks/`) — the two sets are decoupled. Per-repo for multi-repo manifests.

| Domain | Indicators | File |
|--------|------------|------|
| Coding | Any code change; base review-code dimension gates for intent, bugs, operational readiness, design, tests, docs, context adherence | `CODING.md` |
| Feature | New functionality, APIs, enhancements | `FEATURE.md` |
| Bug | Defects, errors, regressions, "not working", "broken" | `BUG.md` |
| Refactor | Restructuring, "clean up", pattern changes | `REFACTOR.md` |
| PR lifecycle | Shipping a change through CI, review, approvals | `PR_LIFECYCLE.md` |
| Prompting | LLM prompts, skills, agents, system instructions | `PROMPTING.md` |
| Writing | Prose, articles, copy, social, creative (base) | `WRITING.md` |
| Document | Specs, proposals, reports, formal docs (base: Writing) | `DOCUMENT.md` |
| Tech design | Design docs consolidating finished understanding into audience-fit standalone technical documentation (base: Document) | `TECH_DESIGN.md` |
| Research | Investigations, analyses, comparisons | `research/RESEARCH.md` |
| Blog | Blog posts, articles, tutorials (base: Writing) | `BLOG.md` |

*Composition:* code-change tasks combine `CODING.md` (base gates) with the specific FEATURE/BUG/REFACTOR; text-authoring combines `WRITING.md` with BLOG/DOCUMENT, and TECH_DESIGN composes onto DOCUMENT/WRITING; Research composes `research/RESEARCH.md` with `research/sources/`. Domains aren't mutually exclusive (a bug fix that refactors uses both). `PR_LIFECYCLE.md` composes when the output ships through a GitHub PR (auto-detected from a github.com `origin`; probe if origin is missing or a github-enterprise host), including tech-design docs shipped as PRs — it templates one AC per repo whose `verify.prompt:` spawns a general-purpose agent that activates the `check-pr` skill — the prompt is the steering surface for per-PR nuances (labels, approvers, flaky-CI/retrigger overrides). **Exception:** PROMPTING does not compose with CODING unless the task also changes executable code.

*Content types:* **Quality Gates** (`## Quality Gates`) → INV-G*/AC-* (omit clearly inapplicable with stated reasoning); **Defaults** (`## Defaults`) → PG-* pre-interview, user reviews and removes if N/A; **Reference files** (`tasks/**/references/*.md`) → verifier-agent lookup data, not loaded during /define.

**Verifier prompt discipline.** Before writing `verify.prompt` fields, invoke the prompt-engineering skill if it is available; if not, apply its core discipline inline. Verifier prompts are prompts: state the verifier's goal, evidence to inspect, PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED contract, and non-obvious context. Do not run a separate prompt-engineering interview — /define owns the manifest interview.

**Encoding gates — always general-purpose + a skill.** There is no `verify.agent` field. Every gate is verified by a **general-purpose** subagent driven by `verify.prompt`; when a gate needs specialized behavior, the prompt tells that agent to **activate a skill**. Code-quality gates activate the `review-code` skill with a dimension; other specialized checks activate their skill (`check-pr`, `review-prompt`). Pattern:

```yaml
verify:
  prompt: |
    Activate the manifest-dev:review-code skill with dimension=<dimension> and review the change.
    PASS only if no <LOW|MEDIUM>-or-higher findings. Report findings with severity.
```

The 13 review-code dimensions are: change-intent, code-bugs, contracts, type-safety (defect-finders, no LOW+); operational-readiness, code-design, code-maintainability, code-simplicity, code-testability, test-quality, docs, prose-value, context-file-adherence (advisory, no MEDIUM+). The `verify.prompt` is already run by a general-purpose verifier execution context, so the prompt must tell *that* verifier to **activate** the skill — never to spawn another agent (a nested spawn bypasses the runtime's PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED contract). For a non-review-code specialized check, name its skill the same way, e.g. *"Activate the manifest-dev:check-pr skill. PR: …"*.

## Manifest Schema

````markdown
# Definition: [Title]

## 1. Intent & Context
- **Goal:** [High-level purpose]
- **Mental Model:** [Key concepts to understand]

## 2. Initial Approach (Complex Tasks Only)
*Initial direction, not rigid plan. Expect adjustment when reality diverges.*

- **Architecture:** [High-level HOW — starting direction]
- **Execution Order:**
  - D1 → D2 → D3
  - Rationale: [why this order]
- **Risk Areas:**
  - [R-1] [What could go wrong] | Detect: [how you'd know]
- **Trade-offs:**
  - [T-1] [Priority A] vs [Priority B] → Prefer [A] because [reason]

## 3. Global Invariants
*Rules that apply to the ENTIRE execution. If these fail, the task fails.*

- [INV-G1] Description: ...
  ```yaml
  verify:
    prompt: "..."             # required, verbatim verifier instruction
    model: "..."              # optional, default = inherit from invoking context
    phase: 1                  # optional integer, default 1; higher phases run after lower pass
  ```

## 4. Process Guidance
*Binding constraints on HOW to work — must hold throughout execution even though no gate verifies them. Only the Initial Approach is soft.*

- [PG-1] Description: ...

## 5. Known Assumptions
- [ASM-1] [What was assumed] | Default: [chosen value] | Impact if wrong: [consequence]

## 6. Deliverables
*Ordered by execution order from Initial Approach, or by dependency then importance.*

### Deliverable 1: [Name]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [AC-1.1] Description: ...
  ```yaml
  verify:
    prompt: "..."             # required, verbatim verifier instruction
    model: "..."              # optional, default = inherit from invoking context
    phase: 1                  # optional integer, default 1; higher phases run after lower pass
  ```

Verifiers return **PASS**, **FAIL**, or **BLOCKED** (waiting on external action — `/do` routes via `/escalate`). Automate verification — criteria that genuinely require human action *to check* belong in Process Guidance, not as ACs; criteria that merely wait on human or external action to be satisfied (deploys, approvals, in-flight CI) stay ACs — the verifier surfaces the wait per its own contract, as BLOCKED or as a FAIL carrying a wait finding, until it clears. Auto-decided items carry `(auto)` after the ID with a matching ASM entry.

**Amendment.** A manifest path in `$ARGUMENTS` means amend. Read it fully, apply targeted changes only — preserve unaffected items verbatim. IDs are stable (modify in place; remove without renumbering). No `## Amendments` log — git is history. Autonomous when caller is `/auto` or `/do` — a mid-/do user message is fire-and-forget steering, so don't ask back or wait; interactive otherwise. In autonomous amendment, every judgment call the steering text doesn't settle is auto-decided per the `(auto)`/ASM discipline — the user's audit trail.

**Flags.** `--babysit <pr-url>` — load `references/BABYSIT_MODE.md`; synthesizes a lifecycle-only manifest from a PR. `--canvas` — load `references/CANVAS_MODE.md`; generates a disposable Shared Understanding Canvas (temp-homed) during the interview. `--autonomous` skips summary approval and lets figure-out self-answer. When the task spans multiple repos (manifest declares `Repos:` in Intent), load `references/MULTI_REPO.md`.

**Summary for Approval.** Before Complete, write a plain-language digest (plan / what / guardrails / how-verified) — no codes, no YAML, no schema vocab. **Test:** reads like talking to a colleague, not a compressed manifest. Approval → Complete; feedback → revise; `/do` → handoff; decline → exit silently. Skip the wait when caller is `/auto` or `/do` amendment, or the user signals "enough".

**Complete.** Emit the load-bearing handoff (`<manifest-path>` is the absolute path you wrote):

```text
Manifest complete: <manifest-path>

To execute: /do <manifest-path>
For unattended execution, invoke /do <manifest-path> as the execution entrypoint. /do reads the manifest and owns the manifest-completion contract: it sets that completion contract when the active harness exposes a goal-setting or continuation capability, or prints the manual copy-paste contract when not. /define does not set a separate /do goal.
```
