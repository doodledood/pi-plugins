# CODING Task Guidance

Base guidance for all code-change tasks (features, bugs, refactors).

## Quality Gates

CLAUDE.md may specify project-specific preferences.

### Base Gates (always applicable)

Each gate is a **dimension** of the `review-code` skill (one ref per dimension, loaded on demand). Two tiers by dimension role. **Defect-finding dimensions** (every LOW finding is signal — a real divergence, defect, contract mismatch, or type hole): `no LOW+`. **Advisory dimensions** (LOW findings are usually taste-level — could-be-better, not is-broken): `no MEDIUM+`. The split is structural, not per-finding — it reflects what each dimension is built to detect.

| Aspect | Dimension | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Intent analysis | change-intent | no LOW+ |
| Mechanical bug detection | code-bugs | no LOW+ |
| Operational readiness | operational-readiness | no MEDIUM+ |
| Maintainability | code-maintainability | no MEDIUM+ |
| Simplicity | code-simplicity | no MEDIUM+ |
| Test quality | test-quality | no MEDIUM+ |
| Testability | code-testability | no MEDIUM+ |
| Documentation | docs | no MEDIUM+ |
| Design fitness | code-design | no MEDIUM+ |
| Prose value | prose-value | no MEDIUM+ |
| CLAUDE.md adherence | context-file-adherence | no MEDIUM+ |

### Conditional Gates (when applicable)

| Aspect | Dimension | Threshold | Condition |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Contract correctness | contracts | no LOW+ | When code calls external/internal APIs, changes public interfaces, crosses service boundaries, or changes durable data contracts (API/event payloads, database schema/table-field semantics, exports, analytics feeds) |
| Type safety | type-safety | no LOW+ | When using typed languages (TypeScript, Python with type hints, Java/Kotlin, Go, Rust, C#) |

**Encoding:** each dimension gate is verified by a general-purpose subagent (there is no `verify.agent` field) whose `verify.prompt` tells that verifier to **activate** the `manifest-dev:review-code` skill for the dimension at the row's threshold — e.g. *"Activate the manifest-dev:review-code skill with dimension=code-bugs and review the change. PASS only if no LOW-or-higher findings."* (Do not say "spawn a general-purpose agent" — the verifier already is one; a nested spawn drops the PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED contract.) See `define/SKILL.md` → "Encoding gates".

## Project Gates

CLAUDE.md specifies project gates (typecheck, lint, test, format). These become Global Invariants.

## E2E Verification

**E2E encoding — route by scope, not blanket INV-G**: don't enumerate every e2e case as its own INV-G. Match the encoding to what you want independently fix-targeted:

- **Single-deliverable behavioral check** (the new path of one Deliverable, run end-to-end) → a **deliverable AC** on that Deliverable, not a Global Invariant. It accepts that deliverable's behavior; it isn't a property spanning the whole manifest.
- **Genuinely cross-cutting e2e** (a scenario that spans multiple Deliverables) → an **INV-G***, specifying the scenario and expected outcome.
- **Comprehensive edge-case matrix** → **test code under the existing project test-run gate**, not enumerated as manifest criteria.

Principle: **manifest criteria are for what you want independently fix-targeted; the suite is for breadth.** Encode a scenario as its own criterion when an isolated PASS/FAIL gives precise repair targeting; otherwise let the suite carry it. Don't turn the manifest into a test-case list.

**E2E phasing**: E2e tests are slow and often deploy-dependent — assign them a later phase than fast automated checks. Manual e2e goes in an even later phase. Only use manual when automated E2E is truly not feasible and user confirms no test data exists.

## Defaults

*Domain best practices for this task type.*

- **Run existing tests before modifying test files** — Verify current test state before changing tests; prevents masking pre-existing failures
- **Read project gates from CLAUDE.md** — Discover project-specific commands (typecheck, lint, test, format) before implementation

## Multi-Repo

When spanning repos: per-repo project gates differ, cross-repo contracts need verification, scope reviewers to changed files per repo.
