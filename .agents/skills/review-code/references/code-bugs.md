# Code-bugs review

Audit the change for mechanical defects — runtime failures, resource issues, and structural code flaws — detectable from code patterns rather than intent-behavior analysis.

## Reasoning discipline

Two reasoning modes are required, both applied to every review:

- **Pattern-matching** — walks the categories below, flagging code whose shape matches a known defect pattern (race, leak, unhandled rejection, dangerous default). Fast. Catches bugs visible in isolated snippets.
- **Mechanism tracing** — follows specific values through specific code paths. For every value the diff writes or reads, ask: who else writes it, who else reads it, what does each closure capture vs. re-read, and what sequence of calls or captures could produce a wrong value? For every new caller of an existing function, hook, context, or callback, enumerate the existing callers and compare assumptions about call order, captured state, and freshness. Catches composition bugs that pattern-matching cannot see — because the bug lives in the *interaction* between changed and unchanged code, not in either snippet alone.

Categories drive pattern-matching. Mechanism tracing is driven by value-following and caller-enumeration. Both modes run. A finding from either mode passes through the same Actionability Filter below.

## Bug detection categories

Categories prompt pattern-matching; mechanism tracing runs in parallel (per Reasoning Discipline above). Walk the categories as failure-mode lenses, not as a checklist — a finding in one category does not stop analysis of others, and a bug that fits this dimension but matches no listed category is still reportable. Respect the Out of Scope boundaries to maintain orthogonality. For large diffs, batch related files (same directory, same module) to manage analysis context.

The items listed under each category are examples of the pattern, not a closed set. If a defect matches the category's spirit but isn't bulleted, it still counts. Thoroughness in looking; discipline in reporting — the Actionability Filter decides what ships to the report.

**Category 1 — Race Conditions & Concurrency**
- Async state changes without proper synchronization
- Concurrent access to shared mutable state
- Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities
- Deadlocks, livelocks

*Report requires naming the specific writers and readers and the interleaving or sequence that produces the wrong value — not just "race condition possible."*

**Category 2 — Data Loss**
- Operations during state transitions that may fail silently
- Missing persistence of critical state changes
- Overwrites without proper merging
- Incomplete transaction handling

**Category 3 — Edge Cases**
- Empty arrays, null, undefined handling
- Type coercion issues and mismatches
- Boundary conditions (zero, negative, max values)
- Unicode, special characters, empty strings

**Category 4 — Error Handling** (focus on RUNTIME FAILURES)
- Unhandled promise rejections that crash the app
- Swallowed exceptions that hide errors users should see
- Missing try-catch on operations that will throw
- Generic catch blocks hiding specific errors

Note: Inconsistent error handling PATTERNS belong to the code-maintainability dimension.

**Category 5 — State Inconsistencies**
- Context vs storage synchronization gaps
- Stale cache serving outdated data
- Orphaned references after deletions
- Partial updates leaving inconsistent state

*Report requires naming the specific state, its writers and readers, and the sequence that leaves it inconsistent — not just "state sync gap" or "cache may be stale."*

Note: Implicit dependencies on execution order belong to the code-maintainability dimension. This category focuses on state that IS explicitly managed but becomes inconsistent.

**Category 6 — Resource Leaks**
- Unclosed file handles, connections, streams
- Event listeners not cleaned up
- Timers/intervals not cleared
- Memory accumulation in long-running processes

**Category 7 — Dangerous Defaults**
- `timeout = 0` or `timeout = Infinity` (hangs forever or never times out)
- `retries = Infinity` or unbounded retry loops
- `validate = false`, `skipValidation = true` (skips safety checks by default)
- `secure = false`, `verifySSL = false` (insecure by default)
- `dryRun = false` (destructive by default when dry-run exists)
- `force = true`, `overwrite = true` (destructive by default)
- `limit = 0` meaning "no limit" (unbounded operations)

The test: "If a tired developer calls this with minimal args, will something bad happen?"

**Category 8 — Fail Loudly**
- Stub or placeholder implementations that silently run the wrong behavior instead of throwing with a clear error message
- Partial implementations that return a default/empty value when the code path should not be reached yet
- `TODO` or `not implemented` paths that return success or silently no-op instead of failing explicitly

The test: "If this unfinished code path is hit in production, will anyone notice?"

Note: This is about code paths that should fail explicitly but don't. If the stub causes a runtime crash or data loss, it's also a Category 3 issue. If the stub produces wrong output that diverges from the change's intent, it's also a change-intent concern. If the code is simply unused (never called), that's dead code — the code-maintainability dimension owns it. If the implementation is incomplete in scope but works correctly for what it handles, that's under-engineering — the code-design dimension owns it. Fail Loudly is specifically about code paths that ARE reached but silently produce wrong behavior instead of failing.

## Actionability filter

Before reporting a bug, it must pass ALL of these criteria. **If it fails ANY criterion, drop the finding entirely.** Only report bugs you are CERTAIN about — "this might be a bug" is not sufficient; "this WILL cause X failure when Y happens" is required.

1. **In scope** — Two modes:
   - **Diff-based review** (default): ONLY report bugs in lines added or modified by this change. Pre-existing bugs in unchanged lines are strictly out of scope.
   - **Explicit path review** (caller specified): Audit everything in scope. Pre-existing bugs are valid findings.
2. **Discrete and actionable** — One clear issue with one clear fix. Not "this whole approach is wrong."
3. **Provably affects code — at mechanism level** — You must identify the specific code path that breaks as a concrete mechanism, not a category label. The finding must name the variable, location, value (vs. expected), and sequence of events that produces the wrong behavior. "Race condition possible on userId" is a shape — reject. "useEffect at line 42 reads `userIdRef.current` after the cleanup at line 58 clears it; second fire produces `undefined`" is a mechanism — accept. The same test as /define's bug-convergence: can you answer *"at line X, variable Y holds value Z because sequence M"*? If not, you have a hypothesis, not a finding — keep tracing or drop it.
4. **Matches codebase rigor** — Before reporting missing error handling or validation, verify the omission is inconsistent with the surrounding codebase. If nearby comparable functions also omit it, the pattern is intentional — drop the finding.
5. **Not intentional** — If the change clearly shows the author meant to do this, it's not a bug (even if you disagree with the decision).
6. **Unambiguous unintended behavior** — Would the bug cause behavior the author clearly did not intend? If intent is unclear, drop the finding.

## Out of scope (orthogonality boundaries)

Do NOT report on (owned by other dimensions):
- **Intent-behavior divergence** (does the change achieve its goal? logic errors, behavioral mismatches) → the change-intent dimension
- **API contract correctness** (wrong params, missing error handling for specific APIs, consumer breakage) → the contracts dimension
- **Type system improvements** that don't cause runtime bugs → the type-safety dimension
- **Maintainability concerns** (DRY, coupling, consistency patterns) → the code-maintainability dimension
- **Over-engineering / complexity** → the code-simplicity dimension
- **Design fitness** (wrong approach, reinvented wheels, under-engineering) → the code-design dimension
- **Documentation quality** → the docs dimension
- **Test coverage gaps** → the test-quality dimension
- **Testability design** (hard to test, mock friction) → the code-testability dimension
- **Context file compliance** → the context-file-adherence dimension
- Security vulnerabilities requiring static analysis (injection, auth design) → separate security audit
- Performance optimizations (unless causing functional bugs)

**Key distinctions from neighboring dimensions:**
- **change-intent** asks: "Does this change do what the author intended?" (intent-behavior analysis). This dimension asks: "Does this code have mechanical defects?" (runtime failures, resource issues, structural flaws).
- **contracts** asks: "Are API calls correct per documentation?" (evidence-based contract verification). This dimension asks: "Will this code crash or leak resources?" (code-pattern defects).

**Rule of thumb:** If the issue requires understanding the change's PURPOSE to identify (wrong logic for the goal), it's the change-intent dimension. If it requires API DOCUMENTATION to verify (wrong params, missing error codes), it's the contracts dimension. If it's a defect pattern recognizable from the CODE STRUCTURE alone (race condition, null deref, resource leak, dangerous default), it's this dimension.

Note: Security issues causing **runtime failures** (crashes, data corruption) ARE in scope. Security issues requiring **static analysis** are out of scope.

**Tool usage**: WebFetch and WebSearch are available for researching unfamiliar APIs or ambiguous language semantics. If web research fails and you cannot be certain about the bug, drop the finding entirely.

## Severity calibration (this dimension)

Severity reflects operational impact, not technical complexity. Refining the shared ladder with bug-specific examples:

- **Critical**: Blocks release. Data loss, corruption, security breach, or complete feature failure affecting all users. No workarounds exist. Examples: silent data deletion, authentication bypass, crash on startup, `secure = false` default on auth/payment endpoints.
- **High**: Blocks merge. Core functionality broken for common inputs — CRUD operations, API endpoints, or user-facing workflows non-functional for primary data types. Affects the happy path. Examples: feature fails for common input types, race condition under typical concurrent load, incorrect business logic calculations, `timeout = 0` on external API calls.
- **Medium**: Edge cases, degraded behavior, or failures requiring multiple preconditions. Affects code paths only reachable through optional parameters or error recovery flows. Examples: breaks only with empty input + specific flag combo, error message shows wrong info, `validate = false` default on internal utilities.
- **Low**: Rare scenarios requiring multiple unusual preconditions, with documented workarounds. Examples: off-by-one in pagination edge case, tooltip shows stale data after rapid clicks, log message has wrong level.

**Calibration check**: Multiple Critical bugs are valid if a change is genuinely broken. However, if every review has multiple Criticals, recalibrate — Critical means production cannot ship.

## Report expectations (this dimension)

Beyond the shared report format: use the **Type** field to name the category from the detection list above. Every Critical/High bug MUST have specific `file:line` references. Where a code snippet showing the bug clarifies the finding, include it. Each finding benefits from a **Reproduction** note (steps or conditions to trigger). An empty report (Status: PASS) is a valid outcome — do not fabricate bugs to fill the report.

## Handling ambiguity

- If code behavior is unclear, **do not report it**.
- If you need more context about intended behavior and cannot determine it, drop the finding.
- When multiple interpretations exist and you cannot determine which is correct, drop the finding.
- **The bar for reporting is certainty, not suspicion.** An empty report is better than one with false positives.
