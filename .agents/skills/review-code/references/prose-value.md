# Prose-value review

Flag prose in code comments and repo doc files that doesn't earn its place — text that restates the obvious, narrates past iterations, leans on AI rhetorical tells, or pads with empty buzzwords.

**The question for every comment and doc paragraph: "What does a future reader lose if this is removed?"** If the answer is nothing, it's bloat.

Prose value is a judgmental axis, so the high-confidence bar matters more here than anywhere else: "this comment might be redundant" is not enough; "this comment restates the function name in English and removing it would lose nothing" is required.

## Audit targets

The only surfaces this dimension reads for findings:

- **Code comments** in source files (any language, line and block comments alike). Test-file *prose* (e.g., `describe`/`it` strings, assertion messages) is out of scope; comments inside test files follow the same rules as comments in any source file and ARE in scope.
- **Repo-resident doc files** — adapt to whatever doc layout the project uses. This skill ships in a plugin installed across many projects; doc conventions vary widely. Discover the actual layout via filesystem inspection (e.g., `ls`, `find`, `glob`) and audit:
  - `README.md` files anywhere in the repo (root, package roots, subprojects)
  - `*.md` files at the repo root (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`)
  - `*.md` files inside whatever conventional documentation directory the project uses

  Common conventional doc directories include (non-exhaustive examples — the actual list depends on the project): `docs/`, `documentation/`, `guides/`, `wiki/`, `website/docs/`, `site/`, `handbook/`. Do not assume a specific path exists; check the filesystem and audit whatever doc directory is present. Some repos use none of these and only have READMEs and root-level `*.md` — that's fine. Some repos have multiple doc trees — audit each. The principle: if it's a `*.md` file the project treats as documentation (not generated, not vendored, not lock data), it is in scope.

**Explicitly NOT audited** (not delegated to a sibling — simply not in scope by design):
- Commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- Issue text, code review comments, external comments, chat transcripts, or any external surface
- Test prose surfaces inside test files: `describe`/`it`/`test` titles and assertion messages (test-prose conventions differ — comments inside test files remain in scope per Audit targets above)
- Generated files, lock files, vendored dependencies

This dimension's surface is repo-resident text in code files and doc files. Everything else is out of scope by design.

## What to inspect

Be comprehensive in analysis, precise in reporting. Examine every audited file in scope against every applicable category — do not cut corners. But only report findings that meet the high-confidence bar in the Actionability Filter. Thoroughness in looking; discipline in reporting.

These categories are guidance, not exhaustive. If you identify a prose-value issue that fits within this dimension but doesn't match a listed category, report it — just respect the out-of-scope boundaries to maintain orthogonality.

### Comment Value (the load-bearing-WHY axis)

Comments earn their place by capturing knowledge a future reader cannot recover from the code itself:

- **Load-bearing-WHY**: A comment that documents non-obvious reasoning — a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, behavior that would surprise a reader, or the *reason* a particular approach was taken over an obvious alternative. These earn their place.
- **WHAT-restatement** *(flag)*: A comment that paraphrases what the next line of code does. `// increment counter`, `// loop through items`, `// return the result`. Removing it loses nothing — well-named identifiers already convey this.
- **Past-iteration narration** *(flag)*: A comment narrating change history or past attempts — `// previously this used a loop, switched to map`, `// fixed the bug from issue #123`, `// added for the new auth flow`. This belongs in commit messages or PR descriptions, not in code; it rots as the codebase evolves.
- **Caller / context references** *(flag)*: `// used by X`, `// called from the Y workflow`. These are search-recoverable and rot when callers change. Belong in PR descriptions, not code.

The test for any comment: would a future reader, encountering only the code without this comment, lose understanding of something non-obvious? If no, flag it.

### Generic Puffery / Empty Buzzwords

Words that signal effort without delivering substance:

- **Hollow superlatives**: "comprehensive", "robust", "powerful", "elegant", "seamless", "cutting-edge" — used without concrete substance. A README that says "comprehensive testing" without specifying what that means is sheen.
- **Marketing-tone in technical docs**: Tone calibrated to impress rather than inform. "Beautifully crafted", "world-class", "best-in-class".
- **Filler intros and conclusions**: "In conclusion, we have shown...", "It's worth noting that..." in short documents that don't need wind-up or wind-down.

### Canonical Decision Value

Repo docs, rules, and comments should reduce future decision cost without creating drift:

- **Duplicated canonical guidance** *(flag)*: A doc/rule repeats guidance that has a clear canonical source elsewhere in the repo or upstream docs, creating two places to maintain the same rule. Prefer a reference to the canonical source plus only the local delta.
- **Placeholder examples** *(flag)*: Examples use fake/stub values where a realistic example would teach the actual decision, constraint, or usage pattern better.
- **Absolute wording for conditional guidance** *(flag)*: Prose states "always" or "must" when the codebase or source docs show the rule applies only under specific conditions.

Only report when you can name the canonical source or the concrete decision a future reader would get wrong.

### AI Rhetorical Patterns

Stylistic tells that propagate from LLM training data into human-facing prose:

- **Em-dash overuse**: Multiple em-dashes per paragraph used as a default separator rather than for genuine parenthetical breaks.
- **"It's not just X — it's Y"** (and structural variants): A formulaic rhetorical contrast pattern that signals AI provenance when used routinely.
- **Tricolon padding / rule-of-three filler**: Lists of three near-synonyms where one would do — "fast, quick, and responsive"; "clear, concise, and easy to understand".
- **Hedge-and-pivot phrases**: "While X is true, it's important to note that Y" patterns used as default transitions.

### Sycophantic / Assistant-Voice Fragments

Leftover assistant-voice that escaped into shipped artifacts:

- **Sycophantic openers**: "Certainly!", "Of course!", "Great question!", "Absolutely!" appearing in code comments or docs.
- **Self-referential AI hedging**: "As an AI", "I should note", "It's worth mentioning that I" — usually leftover from a paste.
- **Apologetic narration**: "I'm sorry, but...", "Unfortunately, I cannot..." style fragments.

## Actionability filter

Before reporting a finding, it must pass ALL of these criteria. **If it fails ANY criterion, drop it entirely.**

1. **In scope** — Diff-based by default (only flag prose introduced or modified by this change). Pre-existing prose is out of scope unless the user invoked an explicit path review.
2. **Removing the prose loses nothing** — For comments: would a future reader, encountering the code without this comment, lose understanding? For doc prose: does this paragraph carry information that's not elsewhere in the doc? If removal is lossless, flag.
3. **Specific tell, not vibe** — "This feels AI-flavored" is not a finding. Name the exact tell (em-dash count, the specific empty buzzword, the WHAT-restatement, the rhetorical pattern). If you can't name it, drop it.
4. **No alternative load-bearing reading** — Before flagging a comment as WHAT-restatement, consider whether it might encode a non-obvious invariant or constraint. When in doubt, do not flag.
5. **Project conventions respected** — If the project uses formal documentation tone or requires verbose comments by policy, calibrate down. Convention overrides default heuristics.

## Out of scope (belongs to a sibling dimension)

Do NOT report on:

- **Documentation accuracy / drift** (docs say X but code does Y) → belongs to the docs dimension. The boundary: prose-value asks *does this prose earn its place*; docs asks *is it accurate vs the code*.
- **Project-specific anti-comment policies** (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md rules about commenting) → belongs to the context-file-adherence dimension
- **Dead code / commented-out code** → belongs to the code-maintainability dimension
- **Code itself is verbose / over-engineered** → belongs to the code-simplicity dimension
- **Standalone authored prose** (articles, marketing copy, blog posts) → outside this dimension's domain; general-purpose handles those when needed

## Special cases / handling ambiguity

- **Empty findings**: A clean PR with no prose-value issues is a valid and positive outcome. Do not fabricate findings.
- **AUTHOR_VOICE.md or style guide present**: If the project documents intentional prose conventions, respect them — the style guide overrides default heuristics.
- **Generated docs**: If a doc file is clearly auto-generated (e.g., from code), lower priority and note as generated.

## Severity calibration

HIGH severity findings should be rare — reserved for prose that clearly signals AI sheen on customer-visible surfaces (READMEs, top-of-file doc blocks). Comment-level issues are usually MEDIUM or LOW.

## Dimension-specific report fields

Focus on WHICH comment or paragraph fails the bar and WHY, with the specific tell named. Beyond the shared report skeleton, each finding should:

- **Category**: `comment-value` | `generic-puffery` | `canonical-decision` | `ai-rhetorical` | `sycophantic-voice` | `other`
- **Tell**: the specific tell — e.g., "WHAT-restatement: comment paraphrases the next line"
- **Prose**: the exact quoted prose
- **Why this fails the bar**: specific reason — e.g., "comment says 'increment counter by 1' on a line that reads `counter += 1`. Removing the comment loses no information."
- **What's needed**: delete the comment, OR replace with a load-bearing-WHY note about <specific reasoning>, OR rephrase without the tell

For clean files, list them concisely: `[CLEAN] <filepath> — N comments / M doc paragraphs reviewed, no findings`.

If no findings, confirm prose appears load-bearing with a summary of what was verified (which surfaces, how many comments / doc paragraphs reviewed). A diff with no prose-value issues is a positive outcome — say so plainly. Do not fabricate findings.
